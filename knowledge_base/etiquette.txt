- Students are encouraged to ask questions freely and challenge ideas.

Classroom Behavior
- Students may leave the classroom quietly (e.g., to use the restroom) without asking permission.
- Eating or drinking during lectures is generally acceptable, as long as it is not disruptive.
- Punctuality is valued, but occasional lateness is tolerated if explained.
- Active participation is encouraged, but silence is also respected.

 Independence & Responsibility
- Finnish education emphasizes self-directed learning.
- Students are expected to manage their own schedules and deadlines.
- Group work is common, but individual responsibility is always highlighted.
- Trust is placed in students to complete tasks without strict supervision.

 Communication Style
- Direct and honest communication is appreciated.
- Teachers and students interact informally, often in a friendly manner.
- Feedback is constructive and aimed at improvement, not criticism.
- Respect for personal space and privacy is important.

 Equality & Inclusion

- Diversity and inclusion are actively promoted.
- International students are encouraged to share their perspectives and cultural backgrounds.

 Summary
